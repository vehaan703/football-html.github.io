<h1 style="color: orange;">Scoring Rules</h1>
<h2 style="color: red;">To score the ball must go into your opponentâ€™s goal. The whole ball needs to be over the line for it to be a legitimate goal. A goal can be scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder. The goal itself consists of a frame measuring 8 feet high and 8 yards wide.</h2>
